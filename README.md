# Full Stack API Final Project

## Full Stack Trivia

Since I'm a student at Udacity academy, I start to write the code for the trivia webpage.<br />
In this webpage, you can:
1) Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer. 
2) Delete questions.
3) Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4) Search for questions based on a text query string.
5) Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category. 

Completing this trivia app gave me the ability to structure plan, implement, and test API skills.


### Backend
The `./backend` directory contains a completed Flask and SQLAlchemy server. app.py defines the endpoints and reference models.py for DB and SQLAlchemy setup.<br />

### Frontend
The `./frontend` directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server.
